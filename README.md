wp-discourse
============

This plugin allows you to *optionally* publish your WordPress blog posts on a Discourse instance. 

Once published, WordPress will fetch the best 5 comments from the Discourse topic and surplant the existing comments section.

Comments and post metadata is synchronized every 10 minutes.
